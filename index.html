          <p>We are thrilled to announce that we have partnered up with the folks at Arsaga's Coffee Roasters. Located in Fayetteville, Arkansas, Arsaga's is a family-owned roastery with six retail locations spread throughout the Fayetteville metropolitan area.</p>
          <br>
          <p>While we can't wait to let their Ethiopian Kayon Mt. Farm speak for itself, here's what the Arsagas had to say about it...</p>
          <br>
          <p>We have a beautiful new coffee from Ismel Hassen's Kayon Mountain Farm in Shakiso Ethiopia. Ismel's family has owned and operated the Kayon Mountain Farm since 2012. They employ 25 full time and 300 seasonal workers. In order to compete with nearby mining jobs, Ismel pays his employees a higher wage and reinvests profits into local school and city administration buildings. Ismel also provides free transportation for his staff.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This coffee has a heavy chocolatey body followed by floral and blackberry tasting notes. The finish is sweet and honey-like. This coffee is really good in every brewing application we've tried it in. It's especially good for drip coffee and espresso.</p>
          <br>
          <p>What's more, this great espresso is available in any of our espresso-based beverages. Be sure to give it a try soon, as this barista favorite is sure to fly off the shelves in no time at all.</p>
